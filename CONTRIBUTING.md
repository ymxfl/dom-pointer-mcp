# 🤝 Contributing to MCP Pointer

Thank you for your interest in contributing to MCP Pointer! This guide will help you set up your development environment and understand our contribution process.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **Node.js** 18+ installed
- **pnpm** installed (required - see [Package Manager](#package-manager))
- **Chrome** browser for extension testing
- **Claude Code** or another MCP-compatible AI tool for testing

## 📦 Package Manager

**IMPORTANT**: This project uses **pnpm** exclusively for dependency management. Using npm or yarn will not work due to:

- Workspace configuration with `catalog:` dependencies
- Build tooling optimized for pnpm
- Team consistency and lockfile management

### Install pnpm

```bash
# Via npm (if you don't have pnpm)
npm install -g pnpm

# Via Homebrew (macOS)
brew install pnpm

# Via script
curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh
```

## 📦 Publishing & Build Process

This project uses automated publishing via GitHub Actions with cryptographic provenance for security and transparency.

### Build System
- **Package Manager**: pnpm with workspaces
- **Build Tool**: esbuild for fast TypeScript compilation  
- **CLI Distribution**: Single bundled `.cjs` file for standalone execution
- **Dependencies**: All external packages bundled for zero-dependency installation

### Publishing Workflow
1. **Automated CI**: Every push/PR runs linting, type checking, and builds
2. **GitHub Releases**: Create a release to trigger automatic npm publishing
3. **Provenance**: Cryptographically links published package to source code
4. **Transparency**: Users can verify the published CLI matches the open source code

```bash
# Create a release to publish
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0
# Or use GitHub's release UI
```

## 🏗️ System Architecture

MCP Pointer uses a distributed architecture with multiple server instances and leader election for high availability:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Browser Environment"
        WEB[Web Page]
        CS[Content Script<br/>element-pointer.ts]
        BG[Background Worker<br/>background.ts]
        ES[ElementSenderService<br/>ReconnectingWebSocket]
        WEB -->|Option+Click| CS
        CS -->|Chrome Runtime API| BG
        BG -->|sendElement| ES
    end

    subgraph "MCP Server Instances"
        subgraph "Instance 1 - Leader"
            WS1[WebSocketService<br/>✅ Port 7007]
            MCP1[MCPService]
            SS1[SharedState<br/>Read/Write]
        end
        
        subgraph "Instance 2 - Follower"
            WS2[WebSocketService<br/>⏸️ Retrying...]
            MCP2[MCPService]
            SS2[SharedState<br/>Read Only]
        end
    end

    subgraph "Shared Resources"
        PORT[Port 7007<br/>First to bind wins]
        FS["/tmp/mcp-pointer-shared-state.json"]
    end

    subgraph "AI Client"
        CC[Claude Code]
    end

    WS2 -.->|Retry every 5s| PORT

    classDef leader fill:#90EE90
    classDef follower fill:#FFE4B5
    
    class WS1,SS1 leader
    class WS2,SS2 follower
```

### How It Works

#### Server-Side (Multiple Instances)

1. **Leader Election:**
   - Multiple MCP server instances can run simultaneously
   - First instance to bind port 7007 becomes the leader
   - Other instances become followers and retry every 5 seconds
   - Automatic failover when leader crashes (~5 second recovery)

2. **State Management:**
   - Leader instance saves element data to `/tmp/mcp-pointer-shared-state.json`
   - All instances (leader and followers) can read shared state
   - MCP requests work on any instance using shared state

3. **Service Architecture:**
   - **WebSocketService**: Handles port-based leader election and WebSocket connections
   - **MCPService**: Provides MCP protocol implementation for AI tools
   - **SharedStateService**: Manages persistent element state via filesystem

#### Client-Side (Browser Extension)

1. **Connection Management (ElementSenderService):**
   - Uses ReconnectingWebSocket library for robust WebSocket connections
   - Exponential backoff: 1s min delay, 10s max delay, 1.5x grow factor
   - Maximum 5 retry attempts per connection
   - 5-second connection timeout
   - Automatic idle disconnection after 2 minutes of inactivity

2. **Element Selection Flow:**
   - Content script captures element data on Option+Click
   - Data sent to background worker via Chrome Runtime API
   - Background worker uses ElementSenderService to send via WebSocket
   - Connection status callbacks provide user feedback (CONNECTING → CONNECTED → SENDING → SENT)

3. **Resilience Features:**
   - Automatic reconnection during server restarts or leader changes
   - Port change handling (disconnects old, connects to new)
   - Connection status monitoring with detailed logging
   - Graceful error handling with status reporting

## 🛠 Development Workflow

### Chrome Extension Development

1. **Build extension in development mode**:
   ```bash
   cd packages/chrome-extension
   pnpm dev  # Builds to dev/ directory with logging enabled and source maps
   ```

2. **Load extension in Chrome**:
   - Open Chrome → Extensions → Developer mode → Load unpacked
   - Select `packages/chrome-extension/dev/` folder
   - The extension will appear in your browser

3. **Making changes**:
   - Files are watched automatically in dev mode
   - Refresh the extension in Chrome Extensions page after changes
   - Check browser console for development logs

4. **Development vs Production**:
   - **Dev build** (`pnpm dev`) → `dev/` folder, includes logging and source maps
   - **Production build** (`pnpm build`) → `dist/` folder, minified, no logs

### MCP Server Development

1. **Run MCP server in watch mode**:
   ```bash
   cd packages/server
   pnpm dev  # Starts server and restarts on file changes
   ```

2. **Test server locally**:
   ```bash
   # In a separate terminal
   node dist/cli.cjs --help  # Test the built CLI
   ```

3. **Configure for development**:
   ```bash
   pnpm -C packages/server configure  # Auto-configure Claude Code
   ```

### Development Commands

```bash
# Build everything for production
pnpm build

# Run linting and type checking
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck

# Fix linting issues automatically  
pnpm lint:fix

# Clean all build outputs
pnpm -C packages/chrome-extension clean
pnpm -C packages/server clean

# Run development servers for all packages
pnpm dev
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Testing Checklist

Before submitting a PR, ensure:

- [ ] MCP server starts with `mcp-pointer start`

## 📋 Release Process

This project uses **Changesets** for automated versioning and publishing. Contributors add changeset files to describe their changes, and maintainers manage releases through automated PRs.

### Using Changesets

When you make changes that should trigger a new release, add a changeset:

```bash
# Add a changeset describing your changes
pnpm changeset
```

This will prompt you to:
1. **Select packages** that should be updated
2. **Choose version bump type** (patch/minor/major)
3. **Write a summary** of your changes

Example changeset session:
```
🦋  Which packages would you like to include?
◉ @mcp-pointer/server
◉ @mcp-pointer/shared
◯ @mcp-pointer/chrome-extension

🦋  Which packages should have a major bump?
◯ @mcp-pointer/server
◯ @mcp-pointer/shared

🦋  Which packages should have a minor bump?  
◉ @mcp-pointer/server
◯ @mcp-pointer/shared

🦋  Please enter a summary for this change
Added WebSocket connection retry logic with exponential backoff
```

### Version Types

- **Patch** (0.1.0 → 0.1.1): Bug fixes, small improvements
- **Minor** (0.1.0 → 0.2.0): New features, backwards compatible
- **Major** (0.1.0 → 1.0.0): Breaking changes

### Creating a Release

**For maintainers only:**

1. **Review pending changesets** in `.changeset/` folder
2. **Push to main** - GitHub Actions will create a "Version Packages" PR
3. **Review the Version PR** - Check version bumps and changelog
4. **Merge the Version PR** - Packages are published automatically

The automated workflow:
- Creates git tags (e.g., `@mcp-pointer/server@0.3.1`)  
- Publishes to npm with provenance
- Creates GitHub releases with changelogs
- Handles monorepo versioning automatically
