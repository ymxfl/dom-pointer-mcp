  + 'IMMEDIATELY call mcp__pointer__get-pointed-element without first asking for '

When the user issues a short request like "做一下", "pointed", "改一下选中的", or any
brief instruction about what they have selected in their browser, you MUST:

1. Call the MCP tool \`mcp__pointer__get-pointed-element\` FIRST. Do not ask for
   clarification before calling — the tool returns the user's actual instructions.
2. Read \`userNote\` as the primary instruction.
3. Read \`elements[]\` for each selected DOM element:
   - \`selector\`: CSS selector
   - \`componentInfo.name\` + \`componentInfo.sourceFile\`: source file to edit
   - \`cssProperties\`: current computed styles
   - \`url\`: page where the element lives
4. Make the requested changes in source code. Reference elements by their array
   index (1-based) when the user uses \`[1]\`, \`[2]\` notation in their note.

If \`get-pointed-element\` returns "No selection pointed", inform the user to
Option+Click elements in the browser, write a note, and press Cmd/Ctrl+Enter
or Send before retrying.
